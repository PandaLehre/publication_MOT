ABSTRACT = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important problem in computer vision that has a wide range of applications. Currently, object occlusion detecting is still a serious challenge in multi-object tracking tasks. In this paper, we propose a method to simultaneously improve occluded object detection and occluded object tracking, as well as propose a tracking method for when the object is completely occluded. First, motion track prediction is utilized to improve the upper limit of occluded object detection. Then, the spatio-temporal feature information between the object and the surrounding environment is used for multi-object tracking. Finally, we use the hypothesis frame to continuously track the completely occluded object. Our study shows that we achieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous vehicles are expected to play a key role in the future of urban transportation systems, as they offer potential for additional safety, increased productivity, greater accessibility, better road efﬁciency, and positive impact on the environment. Research in autonomous systems has seen dramatic advances in recent years, due to the increases in available computing power and reduced cost in sensing and computing technologies, resulting in maturing technological readiness level of fully autonomous vehicles. The objective of this paper is to provide a general overview of the recent developments in the realm of autonomous vehicle software systems. Fundamental components of autonomous vehicle software are reviewed, and recent developments in each area are discussed.},
